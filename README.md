# Nutritional Science Learning App

A simple, client-side web application for learning nutritional science, built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 🌐 Live Demo

The app is deployed and accessible at: **[https://rrust.github.io/ew-bachelor/](https://rrust.github.io/ew-bachelor/)**

## Overview

This project is a single-page application designed to provide a gamified learning experience for students of nutritional science. All content is rendered from local Markdown files, and user progress is stored in the browser's `localStorage`.

## Technology Stack

- **HTML**
- **Tailwind CSS** (via CDN)
- **Vanilla JavaScript**
- **GitHub Pages** (deployment)

There is no backend or build step required.

## How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository.
2. Use a local web server extension (like VS Code's **Live Server**) to open `index.html`. This is necessary to avoid browser CORS errors when fetching content files.
3. Right-click `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server".

## Deployment

The app is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages whenever changes are pushed to the `main` branch. The deployment typically takes 1-2 minutes to complete.
