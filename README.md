# Nutritional Science Learning App

A simple, client-side web application for learning nutritional science, built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Overview

This project is a single-page application designed to provide a gamified learning experience for students of nutritional science. All content is rendered from local Markdown files, and user progress is stored in the browser's `localStorage`.

## Technology Stack

-   **HTML**
-   **Tailwind CSS** (via Play CDN)
-   **Vanilla JavaScript**

There is no backend or build step required.

## How to Run

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Use a local web server extension (like VS Code's **Live Server**) to open `index.html`. This is necessary to avoid browser CORS errors when fetching content files.
3.  Right-click `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server".
